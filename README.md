# TA4 platform

Repo to hold common structures and workflow between the TA-4 performers

## Workflow design

One of the core goals of this repository is to lay out the workflow for users of the CriticalMAAS data pipeline.
The best current description of the envisioned design is contained in TA4's [3-month hackathon read-ahead document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MhvQ_pMNOvtvpuaEP3mYewkofh538ssx4jCdRBrrSoo/edit?usp=sharing).

## Data management

Our data management approach is evolving and is summarized in our [CriticalMAAS data repository document](CriticalMAAS-data-repository.md) and an associated [list of CriticalMAAS tools and data stores](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x5C73yOq6vIbRpuItCSdtQdzkFOmBxYfZbJ2zH1qqxU/edit?usp=sharing).
